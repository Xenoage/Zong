/**
 * Cursor for a score.
 * 
 * This is the most often used selection, since it is also useful for
 * sequential input like needed when reading from a file.
 * The actions can not be undone. If undo is needed, execute commands
 * on the {@link CommandPerformer} from the {@link Score} class.
 * 
 * It contains the current position within the score and provides many methods
 * to write or remove elements and move the cursor.
 * 
 * If the {@link #moving} flag is set, the cursor jumps to the end of written elements
 * instead of staying at its old position. Then it can be at a {@link MP} which
 * still does not exist (e.g. at the end of the score), which isn't a problem
 * since it is created as soon as needed.
 * 
 * There is also the possibility to open and close beams and curved lines.
