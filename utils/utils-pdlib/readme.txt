Xenoage utils-pdlib
*******************

Xenoage utils-pdlib is provided under the MIT license, see license.txt.

Xenoage utils-pdlib (persistent data structures library) provides
persistent and immutable data structures based on the Java Collections API.

Rather than implementing these complicated techniques itself,
this library provides just a wrapper and works with an existing library.
Currently, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pcollections/">pcollections</a>
is used (see license.txt).

The advantage for the developer when using this library is that he always uses
the best implementation in the background. When a better library is available,
pdlib can integrate it, and the developer does not need
to change his own code but only update his copy of pdlib.
